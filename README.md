Static DNS records for demos under the domain "Demo-Gods.net"


Sick of editing hosts files or using .localhost for in DNS records for demos?  Stop sacrificing VMâ€™s to the Demo-Gods.   The Gods have answered with basic DNS for well know frame works in the RFC 1918 space.  I will be changing/adding to this is in near future to facilitate more frameworks including unique IP addrs in both ranges of 10.0.100.0/24 and 172.28.128.0/24.  The current frame of mind is to offer 1, 3, 5 and 7 node frameworks including TXT records to explain. 

Current records:  

	dtr 3660 IN A 10.0.100.6
	dtr 3660 IN A 172.28.128.30

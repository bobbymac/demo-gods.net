## demo-gods.net
Static DNS records for demos under the domain "Demo-Gods.net"


Sick of editing hosts files or using .localhost for in DNS records for demos?  Stop sacrificing VMâ€™s to the Demo-Gods.   The Gods have answered with basic DNS for well know frame works in the RFC 1918 space.  I will be changing/adding to this is in near future to facilitate more frameworks including unique IP addrs in the range 10.0.0.0/8.  The current frame of mind is to offer 1, 3, 5 and 7 node frameworks including TXT records to explain.

Forward DNS is publicly resolvable and the appropriate reverse zone files can be added to your own bind server.

For reverse DNS,  add the following line to named.conf.  Change the SOA to reflect you DNS local server.

```zone "100.0.10.in-addr.arpa" IN { type master; file "100.0.10.in-addr.arpa.zone"; allow-update { none; }; };```

I am not going to go over all the bind syntax or how to configure named.conf but the current format is per /24.
